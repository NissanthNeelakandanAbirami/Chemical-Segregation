# Chemical Segregation with Logistic Regression

## Overview
This repository contains a chemical segregation project that employs Logistic Regression to classify chemicals into specific categories based on their properties. Logistic Regression is a widely-used machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks, and in this project, it is applied to segregate chemicals effectively.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- **data:** Contains the dataset in CSV format.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models:** Saved logistic regression model files.
- **results:** Visualizations and evaluation metrics.
- **utils:** Utility scripts and functions used for data processing and visualization.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using `pip` by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/NissanthNeelakandanAbirami/Chemical-Segregation.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd chemical-segregation

3. Open Jupyter Notebook and explore the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory:


4. Run the notebooks to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset provided in the `data` directory. It contains chemical properties and their corresponding categories for training the logistic regression model.

## Model Performance
The project includes evaluation metrics and visualizations in the `results` directory to assess the performance of the logistic regression model. You can refer to these metrics to understand the accuracy and effectiveness of the chemical segregation.
